Build beautiful, interactive, mobile-ready forms, surveys, and questionnaires without code.

== Description ==

Typeform is online forms reimagined. Use a simple drag-and-drop interface to create any kind of form, survey, or questionnaire, and even take credit card payments. What makes a typeform different from every other kind of form? Using one feels like an interactive conversation, so you’ll get better engagement and more responses—on every device. If you don’t believe us, ask Twitter.

> <strong> Important </strong><br>
> This plugin is for embedding forms created on typeform.com. (You can't edit them or see responses inside WordPress, sorry.) If you haven’t used Typeform before, you can try it out without signing up. Make sure you save your account!

<strong> Next release </strong><br>
* Integrate and sync with .com API, you will be able to connect your Typeform account to list your typeforms instead of pasting the url

Just click the button beside the Media Upload button complete the form fields, just the URL is required.
